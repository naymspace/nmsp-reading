* __[Elm Pages](https://elm-pages.com/blog/introducing-elm-pages/)__, a static site generator similar to gatsby. I hope to build a blog holding this newsletter with it
* __[Interactive Login Mask](https://codepen.io/dsenneff/pen/2c3e5bc86b372d5424b00edaf4990173)__, shared already, but too important to forget!
* __[CSS can do that?](https://dev.to/ananyaneogi/css-can-do-that-18g7)__ Some seem quite usefull and it's definitely nice to know this fancy stuff exists.
* __[Colors and Fonts](https://www.colorsandfonts.com/)__ Nice page with loads of little tools to help you with... well... colors and fonts ;)
